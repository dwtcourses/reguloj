/**
 * <p>The {@link RuleEngine} is responsible for logical reasoning. For that it analyzes a given {@link Context 
 * context} based upon a set of {@link Rule rules}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Both the context and the set of rules have to be supplied with each invocation of any of the available methods.
 * This means that users of this interface will have to hold on to their set of rules somewhere else. You can optimize
 * this set of rules by removing unnecessary elements or combining elements that are known to always fire together.</p>
 *
 * <h1>Caveats</h1>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>The current API design forces every user to call an instance of this engine explicitly and supply both
 *  the context and a set of rules. This may be inefficient for large sets of rules or overly complex context types.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Examples</h1>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>
 *      <p>Test whether any rule would fire for a given context:</p>
 * <pre>
 * Context&lt;X&gt; context = ...;
 * Set&lt;Rule&lt;Context&lt;X&gt;&gt;&gt; rules = ...;
 * RuleEngine&lt;Context&lt;X&gt;&gt; engine = ...;
 *
 * boolean fired = engine.analyze(context, rules);
 * </pre>
 *
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      <p>Launch the engine and fire all valid rules:</p>
 * <pre>
 * Context&lt;X&gt; context = ...;
 * Set&lt;Rule&lt;Context&lt;X&gt;&gt;&gt; rules = ...;
 * RuleEngine&lt;Context&lt;X&gt;&gt; engine = ...;
 *
 * engine.infer(context, rules);
 * </pre>
 *
 *  </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h1>How to help</h1>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Test the interface and write back about errors, bugs and wishes.</li>
 *  <li>Evaluate whether something like RETE can be applied to this interface and how it can be done.</li>
 * </ul>
