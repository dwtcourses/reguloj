h1. reguloj

p. *reguloj* is a small and lightweight Java rule engine. It is suitable for mobile applications running "Android":http://www.android.com/ and/or other restricted environments such as "GWT":http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/.

h2. Usage

h3. Creating rules

p. A rule is composed of a "predicate"::http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Predicate.html, "conclusion":https://github.com/sebhoss/reguloj/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/sebhoss/reguloj/Conclusion.java and a name.

p. Both interfaces require you to implement only a single method and do not restrict you in any way. Complex rules can be created by grouping or chaining predicates/conclusions together with the help of several utility methods. The following example creates a rule composed of 2 predicates and 2 conclusions while using static imports:

bc. 
final Rule rule = rule().called(name)
                        .when(and(predicate1, predicate2))
                        .then(conclude(conclusion1, conclusion2))

h3. Creating an inference context

p. An inference "context":https://github.com/sebhoss/reguloj/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/sebhoss/reguloj/Context.java contains information needed by predicates and/or conclusions. This project supplies a simple implementation of the @Context@ interface called @BaseContext@. Subclass @BaseContext@ in case your rules need extra information. The API acknowledges this by using @<CONTEXT extends Context<?>>@ as type parameter for all methods which expect an @Context@. See item 28 in Effective Java for more details.

h3. Creating rule engines

p. A rule engine evaluates a set of sets in a specific context. The @RuleEngines@ utility class offers to build 3 different rule engines:

bc.. // All rules will be evaluated indefinitely until no further rule fires.
final RuleEngine<CONTEXT> chained = RuleEngines.chained();

// All rules will be evaluated, but only a maximum number of 5 times.
final RuleEngine<CONTEXT> limited = RuleEngines.limited(5);

// Evaluates all rules, stops after the first one that fires.
final RuleEngine<CONTEXT> firstWins = RuleEngines.firstWins();

p. If custom inference behavior is required, subclass @AbstractRuleEngine@ and implement the infer() method.

h3. Evaluating rules

p. A @Set@ of @Rule@ objects are evaluated by a @RuleEngine@ in a specific @Context@. The following example shows how to do it:

bc.. CONTEXT context = ...;
Set<Rule<CONTEXT>> rules = ...;
RuleEngine<CONTEXT> engine = ...;

engine.analyze(context, rules); // true if at least one rule can fired.

engine.infer(context, rules); // perform conclusions of those rules that fired

h3. Integration

p. To use reguloj just declare the following dependency inside your _POM_:

bc. 
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.sebhoss</groupId>
  <artifactId>reguloj</artifactId>
  <version>${version.reguloj}</version>
</dependency>

p. Replace @${version.reguloj}@ with the "latest release":http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Acom.github.sebhoss%20a%3Areguloj

h3. Setup

p. reguloj is using "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/, "Eclipse":http://eclipse.org/ and "Git":http://git-scm.com/ as the main development tools. To build the project yourself just download & install at least Maven 3.0 and call *mvn install* inside the project folder. Maven should then proceed to clean, test, build, package and install the business rules engine.

h3. Versioning

p. reguloj follows the "semantic versioning":http://semver.org/ guidelines.
